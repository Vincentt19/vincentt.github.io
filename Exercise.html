<span style="margin-left:2em">There are many parts of the body you can exercise so it can get confusing on what you should exercise and more importantly how to train it. Many people argue on the time you should wait before training the same muscle again. Upcoming is a list of exercises I found to work and remember to keep in mind to not repeat the same exercises over and over as switching up the exercise can help stimulate the muslces in different ways helping them grow.</span><br>
<br>
<p>Shoulders:</p>
<span style="margin-left:2em">With this area you need to be very careful. Doing these exercises can run the risk of internal rotation. Iternal rotaion is when the shoulder moves in towards the body. Internal rotation with too much weight can lead to lasting shoulder probelms. There are three parts of the shoulders, the front, the middle and rear deltoids.</span>
<p>The front deltoids (anterior head) are responsible for lifting your arms infront of you. To exercise these, the best exercise are standing vertical presses. The reason you want to do these are because they active or used the front deltoids more than others. A lot of people raise their arms infront of them using weight however it is much less effiecent.There are many variation of this press lke the seated press or the standing/seated barbell press however, they do not work the front deltoids as much. You grasp dumbells in each hand and press or lift them up above your shoulders, then lower them down to shoulder level.</p>
<p>The side deltoid (lateral head) is responsible for the lifting of the arms to the side. The best exercise is holding one dumbbell in each hand and lifting vertically using your shoulders. You should use a weight that challanges you but not too much where you can't lift all the way.</p>
<p>The rear deltiod (posteior head) is similar to the side deltiod exercie as you bend at the hip and raise your arms holding weights.</p>

<br>
<p>Chest:</p>
<span style="margin-left:2em">The chest can be trained in many different ways so there are many options.The chest can be split into three different parts; the top, middle, and lower. With the nest exercies you can swap out the dumbells with barbells if you choose.</span>
<p>For the top pec you can do an incline benchpress. You incline the bench so you are at an angle and hold the dumbbells at shoulder level. You procced to press up straight towards the ceiling, hold, then lower down.</p>
<p> For the middle of the chest you can do just a normal benchpress. You lie down on a bench and hold two dumbells. With these you want to press up however you want to position the dumbbells above you chest to fully work the chest and also avoid stress on your shoulders. You then lower them down to the start.</p>
